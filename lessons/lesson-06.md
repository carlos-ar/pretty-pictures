Most textbook images are vector images that depict their message effectively. Here in this lesson, we will learn some of the vector image program basics. We begin with drawing some shapes and learning about the path tool. Then we also incorporate some of our technical image quality knowledge to export our image.

## Learning Objectives

- Participants will draw simple shapes and lines using pre-deterimined shape-tools
- Participants will be introduced to the path tool
- Participants will export their images to a raster image and vector image

## Drawing shapes

When beginning certain diagrams, we tend to use existing shapes for our drawings: boxes and circles, rectangles and stars. In this tutorial we draw some shapes and we do some keyboard short cuts to keep things tidy.

## Introduction to the "path tool"

The path tool is one of the most important and versatile tool ever created for vector images, since everything is considered a path. In this tutorial, we spend some time learning how to use it, and showcase some uses.

## Exporting your image

Since creating vector images is the goal, we export our created image for use in other programs. In this part of the tutorial, we review some of our previous lessons with respect to image quality and file types.
