Since the majority of our work could be simplified with existing images, we start off by doing some tutorials with basic image manipulation on the free open source program Krita. We would do this equivalently with Adobe Photoshop, since it closely resembles this.

## Learning Objectives

- Participants will use basic image manipulation techniques
- Participants will resize image and canvas resolutions
- Participants will flatten and filter a paper/pen drawing

## Image Manipulation

Our first image tutorial we will use revolve around using basic image manipulation techniques, such as rotate and flip, or crop.
