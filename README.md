# Pretty Pictures

This course material was created by Carlos A. Ruvalcaba for the 2019-2020 UC Davis [Professors for the Future](https://gradpathways.ucdavis.edu/pftf-about) Fellowship Program at UC Davis. This is a collection of markdown documents, and some additional scripts and tools meant to supplement the course material. The course material is provided on the [Pretty Pictures](https://carlos-ar.github.io/teaching/prettypics.html) website.

## Project Statement

Research communication has multiple levels: an expert communicating to a general public audience, a researcher giving a presentation to diverse subject-matter experts, or weekly meetings between a late-stage PhD student and their advisor. In all cases, students usually are taught to show all the information relevant to their message, and let the audience determine the quality and relevance of the information presented. However, as information becomes more specialized, and communication spans expert to general public audiences, effective use of time to convey a message is necessary.

For the graduate student and/or postdoctoral scholar population, there is a multitude of time spent generating data, but little time is spent making sure that the data is conveyed with meaningful graphics. Meaningful graphics can aid in conveying a message that is quite complex in writing, but much more insightful with visual help. Some universities hire content creators on a departmental basis to aid researchers in preparation of visual graphics. Graduate students and postdoctoral scholars are expected to learn how to use many of these tools in specialized courses or online tutorials in their own time. These graphics tools can be daunting to the a new user, and many “tricks and tips” are better shown with interactive sessions.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how conveying complex subject specific information can be aided with the use of meaningful graphics. Additionally, participants will be introduced to several free and paid subscription tools that aid in the development of quality graphics.

## Notes

The lessons here were written in markdown, but with the intention of being converted into html pages using Jekyll for my personal research website. They include some raw html code for placing images, YouTube videos, and other content.
